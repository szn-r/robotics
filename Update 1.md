30th September update:

My team is participating in a robotics competition. I am working on a PCB plate that helps to connect the electrical components on our robot in a neat manner as we had previously done so with perfboards, which caused the wiring to be a hassle! 

For our design, we used EasyEDA and had our plates manufactured by JLCPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/?from=see). Our seniors had previously used JLCPCB, hence we were confident in purchasing our plates from them as the plates that my seniors have received were done quickly and with quality. 

This year, we were on a tight budget and would otherwise be unable to purchase the plates if not for JLCPCBsâ€™ sponsorship. We decided to apply for the Educational Program Sponsorship from JLCPCB and were thus able to purchase the plate! We are currently in the middle of finishing up the project as well as applying for the sponsorship!
